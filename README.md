## Penetration Testing Student (PTS) Overview
The eJPT certification is your entry point into the world of penetration testing and ethical hacking. As a certified junior penetration tester, you will gain foundational skills in:

- Networking fundamentals
- Penetration testing methodologies
- Web application testing
- Exploit development
- Privilege escalation

This guide outlines everything I used to succeed, focusing on real-world scenarios, hands-on labs, and key tools that are critical for the exam.

## My Personal eJPT Roadmap

### Stage 1: Preparation & Prerequisites

#### Networking Fundamentals
Before diving into pentesting, mastering networking concepts is critical. Here’s what I focused on:

- TCP/IP, HTTP, and DNS
- Subnetting and CIDR
- Wireshark for packet analysis

**Recommended platform:** [TryHackMe (Network Fundamentals)](https://tryhackme.com)

#### Web Application Penetration Testing
Mastering web vulnerabilities is crucial. I honed my skills by working on:

- Burp Suite for intercepting traffic and fuzzing.
- WPScan for WordPress enumeration.
- Gobuster for discovering hidden directories, files, and DNS subdomains on a web server.

For the exam, understanding how to automate tasks and script exploit code was key. I used:

- Python for understanding simple enumeration scripts.
- Bash scripting for automation in Linux environments.

---

### Stage 2: Practical Pentesting Skills

#### Information Gathering & Scanning
- Nmap for network scanning and finding open ports.
- Metasploit for vulnerability scanning and exploit execution.
- Gobuster for directory and file brute-forcing.

#### Password Cracking
- Hydra and John the Ripper for brute-forcing services.
- Hashcat for offline password cracking.

#### System & Network Attacks
- CrackMapExec for SMB and Active Directory attacks.
- Reverse shells and GTFOBins for privilege escalation.

---

### Stage 3: Exam Preparation

#### Exam Tools Arsenal
I focused heavily on mastering the tools that I would need for the exam, including:

- Nmap for advanced network scans (SAMBA enumeration, service version detection).
- Metasploit for automated exploits (like Drupalgeddon 2).
- Hydra for password brute-forcing.
- Wireshark for packet analysis during reconnaissance.

**Recommended platforms:** 
- Follow the Junior Penetration Tester path on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) 
- Complete the Web Basics and Windows tracks on [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu).

### Stage 4: eJPT Exam Tips & Strategy

- **Use Nmap Effectively:** Start by scanning the network for open ports and services. Use faster scanning options like `-T4` and leverage NSE scripts for service enumeration.
- **Manage Your Time:** Immediately submit flags when discovered to avoid potential session resets. This is crucial during the exam.
- **Privilege Escalation Techniques:** Be ready to exploit misconfigurations, weak passwords, and known vulnerabilities (especially in Drupal and WordPress).
- **Documentation & Note-taking:** Use CherryTree to keep organized notes, commands, and results throughout the exam.

## Tools Arsenal
Here’s a full list of the tools I used:

- **Nmap:** Network discovery and scanning.
- **CrackMapExec:** SMB enumeration and Active Directory attacks.
- **Metasploit:** Exploits and post-exploitation.
- **THC-Hydra:** Password brute-forcing.
- **John the Ripper:** Offline password cracking.
- **Hashcat:** Advanced hash cracking.
- **Burp Suite:** Web application security testing.
- **Gobuster:** Directory brute-forcing.
- **CyberChef:** Data transformation and decoding.
